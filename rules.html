      </header>
      <p>SamurAI Coding is a programming contest in which programmers
	compete for their superiority in AI programming skills.  In
	the contest, the game named <em>SamurAI 3x3</em> (samurai
	three on three) is played by two armies of three samurai each,
	and each of participating AI programs controls one of the
	samurai in each game.  Many games with different army
	composition are played in a contest and the winner will be the
	program controlling the samurai with the highest total
	score.</p>
